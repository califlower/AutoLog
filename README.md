#AutoLog#
###Vehicle maintenance manager###

Allows for the tracking of past and upcoming vehicle maintenance using an easy to use, material design app.

Input your factory recommended maintenance intervals, and your current odometer readings and AutoLog will remind you
when your vehicle needs maintenance. Every week, AutoLog will prompt you to enter new odometer readings in order to keep
track of your new mileage.

App is a work in progress, and does not currently function as needed
